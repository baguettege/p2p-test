v1 - basic connections, message sharing

v1.1 - verification, authentication, commenting, additional packets

v1.2 - file sending
- file sending is primitive
- it loads the entire file into ram at once
- so can crash the program if the file is too large
- there is no accept/declining file sending, can be unsafe if connected to untrusted peer

v1.3 - improved file sending
- data is sent in small packets as a stream instead of all at once, should prevent crashing
- no accept/declining file sending in place yet

v1.35 - accept/decline file transfer, very spaghetti code
- each file transfer has to be accepted/declined
- no automatic cooldown
- code is very spaghetti
- working on cleaning it up

v1.4 major code cleanup & file transfer improvements
- peer auth, accepting & file transfer moved to their own classes (no more boolean spam)
- renaming of classes for clarity
- logs make more sense
- commands grouped up/more straightforward to use
- console cmd communication given respective classes for simpler use
- changed .log writing to latest.log to not spam logs folder
- added ability to cancel file transfers & requests
- some commands are now blocked before authorization
- gui is now in dark mode
